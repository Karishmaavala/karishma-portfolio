<strong>üñºÔ∏è From Selfies to Sketches: Building an Image Cartoonization Tool</strong>

<em>Turning ordinary selfies into vibrant cartoon sketches was more than just a fun experiment‚Äîit was a journey through the artistic side of computer vision. In this post, I delve deep into how I engineered an image cartoonization tool using OpenCV, blending classical image processing filters with modern UI design. The project began with a curiosity: how can we give a real image a hand-drawn look without using any AI models? My approach was based on chaining techniques like bilateral filtering, grayscale conversion, edge detection using adaptive thresholding, and blending color masks back into the image.

I walk through each stage of image transformation‚Äîstarting from raw image capture to converting it into a clean pencil sketch and finally transforming it into a colored cartoon version. The filter pipeline design taught me how sequence matters in visual output. I experimented with Gaussian blurs, median blurs, color smoothing, and edge enhancement to find the perfect cartoon aesthetic.

Alongside the algorithmic implementation, I focused on creating a clean, responsive web interface using Flask, allowing users to upload an image and instantly see its cartoon version. This project not only improved my OpenCV skills but also gave me insight into how artistic effects can be achieved with mathematical precision.

Whether you're curious about image filters, love cartoons, or want to explore Python‚Äôs visual capabilities, this blog will show you how filters and code can paint a whole new perspective.</em>
