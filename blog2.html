    üì∞ Building a News Management System with React and Node

<p>üìÖ May 28, 2025 </p>  <p>‚è±Ô∏è 5 min read </p> <p> üß™ Tech Stack: React.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB</p>

<em>Creating a digital content management system was one of my most rewarding frontend-backend integration challenges. This project involved building a full-featured News Management System that allows administrators to create, edit, delete, and manage articles dynamically through a seamless dashboard.

The frontend was built with React.js, featuring a sleek, component-driven layout with responsive cards and modals. I implemented a sortable, searchable article table with pagination, filters, and category-based organization. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express to build REST APIs and MongoDB for storing all article data securely and efficiently.

One of the key learning outcomes was implementing token-based admin authentication, route protection, and optimized database queries for faster loading. I also incorporated form validation, image previews, and success/error toasts for a professional user experience.

The system supports markdown for article formatting, rich text editing, and an analytics section to show article engagement metrics. This project refined my full-stack development workflow and gave me hands-on experience with real-world news publishing architecture.

If you're interested in web apps that combine powerful backend logic with interactive frontend dashboards, this blog takes you through each functional layer of a professional-grade content manager.</em>
